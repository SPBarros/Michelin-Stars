# Michelin Star Data for 'The Orchid Luxe Hotel'

Michelin stars are prestigious awards given by the Michelin Guide to exceptional restaurants. Established in 1926 by the French tire company Michelin, the stars were initially meant to encourage road travel and tire sales by highlighting outstanding dining establishments. The rating system evolved to its current form in 1931, with one star indicating a "very good restaurant," two stars denoting "excellent cooking that is worth a detour," and three stars representing "exceptional cuisine that is worth a special journey."
